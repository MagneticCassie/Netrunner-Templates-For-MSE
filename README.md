# HOW TO USE

You can just click on most fields to enter text. You can use Format -> Insert Symbol to add special symbols and characters into the text box and title, as well as for the numbers for the MU, Advancement Requirement, and Agenda Points fields.

Faction: Click on the card border to change.

Influence: Click in the influence area to select the card's influence value.

Card type/Keywords Field: Use "italics" for the card type and regular text for the other keywords. The italics key is bound to a different font for this purpose.

Trash Icon: There is a small box on the corp cards which can be clicked to toggle the trash icon.

MU: Use the MU Cost menu in the Symbol menu to choose the appropriate number graphic for a program's MU value. Don't use plain text for this field.

Advancement Requirement: Use the Advancement Cost menu in the Symbol menu to choose the appropriate number graphic for an agenda's advancement requirement. Don't use plain text for this field.

Agenda Points: Use the Agenda Points menu in the Symbol menu to choose the appropriate number graphic for an agenda's agenda point value. Don't use plain text for this field.
